MEW Marketplace

Project is affectionately inspired by my love of cats and animals, and my passion for conservation of wildlife species.
The concept is around building a storefront between adopters and conservationist/storeowners, purchases in which funds conservation causes..

- Admins - approving store requests
- MEW Adopters - browse through digitized animals
- MEW Store Owners - add/ sell digitized, initiate stores, make Ether
